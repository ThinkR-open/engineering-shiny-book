## Prototyping is crucial

### Prototype, then polish

// TODO

> Prototyping first may help keep you from investing far too much time for marginal gains.

http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#rule_of_optimization

And yet another Rule from the Art of Unix Programming: "Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. __Get it working before you optimize it__."

Getting things work before trying to optimize the app is always a good approach: 

+ Making things work before working on low level optimization makes the whole engineering process easier: having a "minimal viable product" that works, even if slowly and not perfectly, gives a stronger sense of success to the project. 
If you are building an vehicule, it feels more of a success to start with a skateboard than with a wheel.

+ Abstraction is hard, and makes the code base harder to work with. 
You've heard a lot that if you are copying and pasting something more than twice, you should write a function. 
And with Shiny, if you are writing a piece of the app more than twice, you should write modules. 
But while these kind of abstractions are elegant and optimized, they can make the software harder to work on while building it. 
So before focusing on turning something into a function, make it work first. 
As said in [R for Data Science]() about abstraction with `{purrr}`: 

> Once you master these functions, you’ll find it takes much less time to solve iteration problems. But you should never feel bad about using a for loop instead of a map function. The map functions are a step up a tower of abstraction, and it can take a long time to get your head around how they work. The important thing is that you solve the problem that you’re working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that’s definitely something you want to strive towards!).

`r right_link("R for Data Science - 21.5 The map functions", "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html")`

As a small example, we can refer to the binding module from `{hexmake}`: this module manipulates namespace, inputs and session to automatically bind inputs to the R6 object containing the image (see implementation [here](https://github.com/ColinFay/hexmake/blob/master/R/mod_binder.R#L29), [here](https://github.com/ColinFay/hexmake/blob/master/R/utils_server.R#L2) and [here](https://github.com/ColinFay/hexmake/blob/master/R/mod_left.R#L60)). 
That's an elegant solution: instead of duplicating content, we use functions to automatically bind events.
But that's a highter level of abstraction: we manipulate different levels of namespacing and inputs, making it harder to reason about when you have to change the code base a lot. 

+ It's hard to identify upfront the real bottlenecks of the app. 
As long as the app is not in a working state, it's very hard to identify the real pieces of code that need to be optimized. 
Chances are that if you ask yourself upfront what the app bottlenecks will be, you won't aim right. 
So instead of losing time focusing on specific pieces of code you think need to be optimized, start by having something that works, then optimize the code. 

+ It's easier to spot mistakes when you have something the can run. 
If a piece of software runs, it's straightforward to check if a change in the codebase break the software or not: it either still run or not. 

### The "UI first" approach

Now that we are set for prototyping first, where should we start? 

Using what can be called a "UI first" approach when building an app is in most cases the safest way to fo. 
And for two main reasons.

#### Agreeing on specification

First of all, it helps everybody involved in the application to agree on what the app is supposed to do, and once the UI is set, there should be no "surprise implementation". 
Well, at least, this is the best way to reduce the number of changes in the app, as the sooner we have a global idea of the app the better: it is often hard to implement a core new feature once the app is 90% finished when thinking of it from the very start.
Indeed, implementing core feature once the app is very advanced can be critical, as our application might not have been thought to work the way it now needs to work, so adding certain elements might lead to a need for change in the core architecture of the app.

Once we agree on what elements there are in the app, there is no sudden “oh the app needs to do that thing now, sorry I hadn't realized that before”.
And we can't blame the person ordering the app for not realizing everything needed: it's really hard to have a mental model of the whole app when we are reading specifications. 
On the other hand, having a mock application with the UI really helps realising what the app is doing and how it works, and to agree with the developer that this is actually what we want our application to do. 

Prototyping the UI first should require the least possible calculations from the server part of your application. 
You focus on the appearance of the app: buttons, figures, tables, graphs... and how they interact with each other. 
At that stage of the design process, you will not be focusing on correctness of the results or graph: you will be placing elements on the front-end so that you can be sure that everything is there, even if some buttons do not trigger anything. 
At that point, the idea is to get the people ordering the app think about what they actually need, and there might be some question rising like "oh, where is the button to do that download that results in pdf?". 
And now is the best moment for a change in specification. 

#### Organising work

A pre-defined UI allows every person involved in the coding to know which part of the app they are working on, and to be sure that you do not forget anything. 
As you might be working on the app as a team, you will need to find a strategy for efficiently splitting the work between every coder. 
And it’s much easier to work on a piece of the app you can visually identify and integrate in a complete app scenario. 
In other words, it's easier to be told "you will be working on the 'Summary' panel" than "you will be working on bullet poing 45 to 78 of the specifications". 

## Prototyping Shiny

### Fast prototyping with `{shinipsum}`

The goal of {shinipsum} is to provide random shiny elements to simulate interface outputs.
Use `lorem`, the long "Lorem Ipsum" text to fill in text parts.
Use the `random_*` functions in the `server` part of your application in combination with the appropriate `render*()`.
This will fill the corresponding call to `*Output()` in the `UI`.  
For instance:  

- `random_DT()` renders a `DT::datatable()` output with one of existing R internal datasets.  
- `random_ggplot(type = "point")` renders a random {ggplot2} graph with the selected `type` (corresponding to `geom()` in {ggplot2}).  
- `random_text(nwords = 10)` renders a text with the defined number of words.  

```r
library(shiny)
library(shinipsum)
library(DT)
ui <- fluidPage(
  h2("A Random DT"),
  DTOutput("data_table"),
  h2("A Random Plot"),
  plotOutput("plot"),
  h2("A Random Text"),
  tableOutput("text")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$data_table <- DT::renderDT({
    random_DT(5, 5)
  })
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    random_ggplot()
  })
  output$text <- renderText({
    random_text(nwords = 50)
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
```{r prototyping-fakir-shinipsum-1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/shinipsum.png")
```

### Using `{fakir}` for fake data generation

`{fakir}` was primarily created to provide fake datasets for R tutorials and exercises. 
"Fake support ticket dataset" is built using `fake_ticket_client()` and "Fake questionnaire on mean of transport / goal dataset" is built using `fake_sondage_answers()`.
They contain dates, numeric and character variables, with missing values allowing multiple exercises on data cleaning and graph building. 
They can also be joined with the included {sf} geographical dataset `fra_sf` allowing for maps creation.  
Fake datasets created with {fakir} can be used to build light examples on the use of the inputs, for filters or interactive maps for instance. 
When building your application inside a R package, as recommended in this book using {golem}, you may want to build small reproducible examples of your functions, to be presented in the vignettes and tested in the unit tests, prior to building the Shiny Apps itself. 
You can create these examples using {fakir}.
