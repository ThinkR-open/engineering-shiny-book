## CI and testing

Testing is central for making your application survive on the long run. The {testthat} package can be used to test the "business logic" side of your app, while the application features can be tested with packages like {shinytest}, or software like Katalon.

Docker, Shiny Proxy, RStudio Connect... Don't just put your app on the server and let it live. Use tools that are specifically designed for deploying and scaling web applications.
