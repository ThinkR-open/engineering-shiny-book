## Designing the UI

Choosing a UI is hard — we have a natural tendency, as coders, to be focused on the backend, i.e the algorithmic part of the application. But let's state the truth: no matter how complex and innovative your backend can be, your application is bad if your UI is bad. That's the hard truth. If people can't understand how to use your application, your application doesn't work. No matter how incredible the backend is. 

Try to find a simple, and efficient UI. One that people can understand and use in a matter of seconds. Don't implement features or visual elements that are not actually needed, just "in case". And spend time working on that UI, really thinking about what visual elements you are implementing.

## Working as a team

Big Shiny Apps usually mean that several people will work on the application. For example, at ThinkR, 3 to 4 people usually work on the application. So, how do we organize that?

### From the tools point of view: 

+ Use version control (not sure I have to expand on that topic ;) )
+ Think of your shiny app as a tree, and divide it as much as possible into little pieces. Then, create one Shiny module by piece. This allows you to split the work, and also to have smaller files — it's easier to work on 20 files of 200 lines than on one big app.R file. 

### From the organisational point of view

 + Define one person in charge of having the big picture of the app. This person will kick off the project, and write the skeleton of the app, with the good modules and files structure. This person will also be in charge of accepting new merge requests from other developers, and to orchestrate the master and dev branches. 
+ List the tasks, and open one issue for each task on your version control system. Each issue will be solved in a separate branch. 
+ Finally, assign one module to one developer — if it seems that working on one module is a two-person job, divide again into two other submodules. This is a relatively complex task, as the output of one module influences the input of another, so be sure to assign them well. 

## Making the app production ready

### Scaling

This includes two things: scaling and maintaining. As said in the disclaimer, I won't expand on the topic of scaling, as many have written about that, but here is one piece of advice: make the R process running the app do as little as possible, and in particular prevent it from doing what it's not supposed to do. Which includes: use JavaScript so that the client browser renders things (instead of making R do the work — basic JS is easy to learn), use parallelization and async, and if possible, make the heavy lifting be done outside the R session running the app. 

// TODO: link to resources.

### Maintaining

Maintainance, on the other hand, is something to think about from the beginning.  It includes being able to ensure that the application will work in the long run, and that new features can be easily implemented. 

+ Working in the long run: separate the code with "business logic" (aka the data manipulation and the algorithm, that can work outside the context of the app) from the code building the application. That way, you can write regression tests for these functions to ensure they are stable. 
+ Implement new elements: as we are working with modules, it's easy to insert new elements inside the global application. 

// TO DO: be more precise on the tooling.
